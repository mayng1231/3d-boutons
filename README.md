# 3d Bouton Plots
This repository contains 547 boutons--proofread by hand in Webknossos--whose 32nm and 16nm resolution EM masks were downloaded by slices through the SegCLR notebook using Tensorstore 2 and reconstructed using Plotly. These boutons are available for download and viewing through the HTML files.

*Example: Bouton_097*

The 3D reconstructions will be linked from an interactive HDBSCAN cluster plot to assist in determining the clusters generated from SegCLR embeddings.
